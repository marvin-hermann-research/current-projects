# Current Projects – Active Research & Development

This repository aggregates links and summaries for all projects I am actively developing. These projects span topics such as robotics, AI, control systems, and scientific computing.

Each project resides in a dedicated repository and is under active development, experimentation, or evaluation.

## Active Repositories

- [Modular Behaviour Tree Architecture for ROS2](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/ros2-architecture-lab)  
  A research-oriented framework for robotic locomotion in ROS2, integrating Behaviour Trees with a distributed sensor–actuator architecture.
- (More to be added)

---

##  Methodology

Each project aims to balance:

- Practical implementation  
- Theoretical depth  
- Clean architecture and documentation  
- Transparent logging of errors, insights, and iterations

---

## Contribution

While these projects are personal, I welcome feedback, suggestions, or collaboration requests.
