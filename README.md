# Current Projects – Active Research & Development

This repository aggregates links and summaries for all projects I am actively developing. These projects span topics such as robotics, AI, control systems, and scientific computing.

Each project resides in a dedicated repository and is under active development, experimentation, or evaluation.

## 🛠️ Methodology

Each project aims to balance:

- Practical implementation  
- Theoretical depth  
- Clean architecture and documentation  
- Transparent logging of errors, insights, and iterations

## 🌐 Contribution

While these projects are personal, I welcome feedback, suggestions, or collaboration requests.
